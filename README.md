REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install composer if you have not any:
~~~
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin"
~~~

Get the project and all dependencies:
~~~
php composer.phar create-project skoro/yii2-admin-template yii2-admin 0.2
~~~

Answer the questions and if you need apply database migrations. And that's all.
In case if you cannot install project via composer read next chapters.

MANUAL INSTALLATION
-------------------

Clone project repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/skoro/yii2-admin-template.git yii2-admin
```

Install dependencies:
~~~
composer.phar install
~~~

Check project requirements:
~~~
./bin/requirements
~~~

Change to project directory and set permissions:
~~~
chmod 777 ./runtime ./web/assets
~~~

Create your host configuration by copying sample:
~~~
cp config-sample.php config.php
~~~

Set cookie validation key in `config.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '',
],
```

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Your local site configuration resides in `config.php`. You can create `config.php`
by copying `config-sample.php`.

### Database

Edit the file `config.php` in web root folder with real data, for example:
```php
'db' => [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    // Or SQLite3 database (directory data must be already created and must be
    // writable by webserver).
    // 'dsn' => 'sqlite:@runtime/data/db.sq3',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

Apply database migrations:
```
./bin/yii migrate
```
This imports user schema into your database.

### Enable debug mode

To enabled debug bar uncomment following lines in `config.php`:
```php
define('YII_DEBUG', true);
define('YII_ENV', 'dev');
```

If you are on local network (not 127.0.0.1) make debug modules happy with
following lines:
```php
    'modules' => [
        'debug' => [
            'allowedIPs' => ['192.168.1.*'],
        ],
        'gii' => [
            'allowedIPs' => ['192.168.1.*'],
        ],
    ],
```
These lines enable `debug` and `gii` modules for clients from `192.168.1.*`
subnetwork.

TESTING
-------

After application has been installed and configured it's time to test it.
First of all, create user via command `yii` line utility:
```
./bin/yii user/create mail@address.com "User name"
```

Then launch local web server:
```
./bin/yii serve
```

Now you can access the application through the following URL and try to login:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
